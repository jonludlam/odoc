(** What the driver builds: units, grouped into libraries and packages.

    A {e unit} is one artifact odoc compiles: a module interface, a module
    implementation, a page or an asset. A {e library} groups the units of its
    modules. A {e package} groups its libraries and its pages, and is the thing
    the driver builds in one go. See {!Odoc_units_of} for how these are made
    from what is installed, and {!Compile} and {!Build} for what is done with
    them. *)

(** {1 Where things go}

    Identifiers follow one layout and files on disk another.

    {e Identifiers} put a package's pages under the package's name, and a
    library's modules under [<pkg>/<lib>]. They decide the URLs.

    {e Files} mirror the switch. A library's [.odoc] files are written at the
    path of its object directory, [lib/<findlib dir>]. Libraries that share a
    directory in the switch therefore share one here, and the [-I] search path
    is the compiler's. A package's pages are written below [doc/<pkg>]. Every
    location is a function of a name, so a run finds what earlier runs built
    with no record of them. The same paths hold below the odocl directory. *)

val pkg_dir : Packages.t -> Fpath.t
(** The identifier of the package's top-level page, and the root of its HTML. *)

val doc_dir : Packages.t -> Fpath.t
(** The identifier below which the package's pages live. *)

val lib_dir : Packages.t -> Packages.libty -> Fpath.t

val src_dir : Packages.t -> Fpath.t
(** The identifier below which rendered sources live. *)

val src_lib_dir : Packages.t -> Packages.libty -> Fpath.t

val lib_obj_dir : Packages.libty -> Fpath.t
