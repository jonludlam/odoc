Simple strengthening

This tests that strengthening works. When we strengthen a signature we recursively add
type equations for all abstract types.


BEFORE
======
type t/0 
type u/1 = local(t/0,false)
 (removed=[])
AFTER 
======
type t/2 = resolved(identifier((root Root))).t
type u/3 = local(t/2,false)
 (removed=[])
