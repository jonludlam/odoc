Simple strengthening

This tests that strengthening works. When we strengthen a signature we recursively add
type equations for all abstract types.


BEFORE
======
type t/24 
type u/25 = resolved(t/24)
 (removed=[])
AFTER 
======
type t/26 = resolved(identifier((root Root))).t
type u/27 = resolved(t/26)
 (removed=[])
