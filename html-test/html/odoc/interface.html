   </h1>
   <p>Odoc has several 'public facing' parts, with varying levels of 
    support guarantees. This document describes what those interfaces
     are and what the support levels are now and what we aim for in the
     future.

   <h3 id="documentation-comments">
    <a href="#documentation-comments" class="anchor"></a>Documentation
     comments
   </h3>
   <p>The first and most important is the syntax of the documentation
     comments present in source code. This is relevant to everyone who
     is writing code intended to be documented by odoc, and hence is 
    applies to the widest set of people. The differences are documented
     in a <a href="markup.html">separate page</a>.
   </p>
   <h3 id="cli-interface"><a href="#cli-interface" class="anchor"></a>
    CLI interface
   </h3>
   <p>The way in which the odoc CLI is invoked is not trivial, and requires
     careful ordering and correct arguments to produce correctly linked
     documentation. It is not expected that end-users will invoke odoc
     by hand, but rather it will be driven by a separate tool. As a 
    consequence of this it is important that we preserve the ability 
    of these tools to create good documentation with each release of 
    odoc, and thus we will ensure backward compatibility of the CLI as
     much as possible. There are currently 3 tools that 'drive' odoc 
    that are considered 'first class' in that we will not make releases
     of odoc whilst knowingly breaking these tools. These are:
   </p><ul><li>Odig</li><li>Dune</li><li>OCaml</li></ul>
   <p>OCaml here refers to the newly merged configure option (from 4.12.0)
     to build the standard library documentation with odoc. If the 
    recommended way of invoking odoc changes we will work with the 
    maintainers of these projects to ensure they are updated correspondingly.
   </p>
   <p>Additionally there will be a reference implementation of a tool
     to build Odoc's documentation which should serve as a guide for 
    anyone building other 'drivers' of odoc.
   </p>
   <h3 id="output-formats"><a href="#output-formats" class="anchor"></a>
    Output formats
   </h3>
   <p>Odoc currently outputs HTML files, man pages and latex documents.
     In a similar vein to the CLI interface, we will try to ensure that
     the three tools described above will will not be broken by any changes
     to the outputs - that is, that they will succeed and produce 
    documentation that is 'correct'. We do not make any guarantees about
     the internal structure of the output documents - for example, the
     exact nesting of tags or sequence of latex commands may not be 
    preserved. We will attempt to ensure that the anchors in the HTML
     are preserved though, implying also that the filenames will also
     be preserved.
   </p>
   <h3 id="libraries"><a href="#libraries" class="anchor"></a>Libraries</h3>
   <p>Odoc has several internal libraries. The only one of these for 
    which we currently expect external users is the comment parser. This
     will soon be removed into an external package to link with separately
     and will have its own lifecycle and support statement. Note that
     this will replace the existing <code>octavius</code> library, which
     was the original implementation of odoc's current parser.
   </p>
   <h3 id="intermediate-files">
    <a href="#intermediate-files" class="anchor"></a>Intermediate files
   </h3>
   <p>The intermediate files that odoc produces - <code>.odoc</code> 
    and <code>.odocl</code> should be considered to be internal only 
    and tied to the specific version of odoc.
